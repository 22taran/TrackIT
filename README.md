Open source mobile app to help track proximity contacts using powerful bluetooth technology

### How does it work

App uses bluetooth functionalities of your phone to scan as many devices in certain area as possible. When app scans the device it stores it into memory.

App is saving scanned devices with their special id identifier. Identifier can be put as compromised by only officials who are conducting tests then notification arrives for the user who have been in close proximity of the infected identifier , saying that he needs to give all necessary contact information to officials and to stay home.

If user is signed trough system as "isolated" and comes in proximity of other devices officials will be notified of that health breach.
